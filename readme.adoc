= Idea Hub for jQAssistant

This is the place for you to request totally new features and bigger enhancements
for existing ones.

== Motivation

jQAssistant consists of multiple modules, each with his own Git repository
here in this Github organisation. Not being deeply familiar with the structure
of jQAssistant, this can be confusing.

Therefore we created the **Idea Hub for jQAssistant**. It is intended
to be a reservoir for suggestions and ideas by the users of jQAssistant.

== Usage Guidelines

1. Check if your issue might be belong to one the already existing modules. If
   yes, please file your issue there.
2. If you would like to suggest a totally new feature or if you are not
   certain where your issue belongs to, please file it here.

== Review of your issues

We will regularly have a look at all the issues in the Idea Hub, moving
them to the right repository and prioritizing them.
